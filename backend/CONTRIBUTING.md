## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Your contributions are what make open-source projects thrive. Whether you're fixing a bug, improving the documentation, or adding a new feature, your efforts are greatly appreciated. Below are the steps to get started with contributing to the project.

### 1. Fork the Repository

If you're new to contributing, start by forking the repository:

1. Go to the project repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner to create your own copy of the repository.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Next, clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repo.git
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-forked-repo` with your GitHub username and the repository name.

### 3. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your work to keep your changes isolated from the `main` branch:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `fix/issue-123` or `feature/add-new-feature`.

### 4. Make Your Changes

Make your changes or add your new features. Be sure to:

- **Follow Coding Standards**: Maintain the coding style used in the project. Run linters like ESLint and format your code with Prettier, if applicable.
- **Write Tests**: If applicable, write unit and/or integration tests to cover your changes.
- **Update Documentation**: If your changes affect the documentation, make sure to update it accordingly.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
```

Use a clear and concise commit message that describes your changes.

### 6. Push to Your Fork

Push your branch to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request

Go to the original repository on GitHub and you'll see a prompt to create a Pull Request (PR) from your pushed branch. Follow these steps:

1. Click the "Compare & pull request" button.
2. Provide a detailed description of your changes in the PR description.
3. Submit the Pull Request.

### 8. Review Process

Your Pull Request will be reviewed by the maintainers. You may be asked to make some changes before your code can be merged. Engage in the discussion and make the necessary updates.

### 9. Merge Your PR

Once approved, your PR will be merged into the main branch. You can now delete your branch from your fork if desired:

```bash
git branch -d your-branch-name
git push origin --delete your-branch-name
```

### 10. Stay Updated

If you plan to continue contributing, keep your fork updated with the latest changes from the original repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo-owner/original-repo.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

This will help prevent merge conflicts in future contributions.
